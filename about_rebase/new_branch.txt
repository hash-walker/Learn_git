New Branch
We need a new feature branch, but to be able to practice a rebase, we want it to not include some of the recent commits on main.

Assignment
Use the git switch command to create and switch to a new branch called update_dune, but branch off of the D commit. You can supply the commit hash directly to the git switch command:
git switch -c update_dune COMMITHASH
Copy icon
Replace COMMITHASH with the hash of the D commit, which you can get with a git log command.

Verify with git log --oneline -n 1 that you are on the new branch and that D is the last commit.
