Default Branch
We've been using Git's default master branch. Interestingly, GitHub (a website where you can remotely store Git projects) recently changed its default branch from master to main. As a general rule, I recommend using main as your default branch if you work primarily with GitHub, as we will.

How to Rename a Branch
git branch -m oldname newname
Copy icon
Assignment
Change your global Git configuration to use main as the default branch. Change the init.defaultBranch key to main.
Check your current branch:
git branch
Copy icon
You should notice that you're still on master! That's because all you did was change the default branch for new repositories.

To switch this repo to use main, rename the master branch to main.
Run git branch again to make sure you're on the main branch.
