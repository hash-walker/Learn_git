Git Files
KungFu? No, Gitfu.

Remember, Git stores all its information in files in the .git subdirectory at the root of your project, even information about branches. The "heads" (or "tips") of branches are stored in the .git/refs/heads directory. If you cat one of the files in that directory, you should be able to see the commit hash that the branch points to.

Assignment
Use find and cat to find the commit hash that your main branch points to.
