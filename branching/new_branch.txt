New Branch
You should already be on the main branch: your "default" branch. You can always check with git branch.

Two Ways to Create a Branch
git branch my_new_branch

This creates a new branch called my_new_branch. The thing is, I rarely use this command because usually I want to create a branch and switch to it immediately. So I use this command instead:

git switch -c my_new_branch

The switch command allows you to switch branches, and the -c flag tells Git to create a new branch if it doesn't already exist.

When you create a new branch, it uses the current commit you are on as the branch base. For example, if you're on your main branch with 3 commits, A, B, and C, and then you run git switch -c my_new_branch, your new branch will look like this:

branch diagram same commits

Assignment
Create and switch to a new branch called add_classics, it should have the same commits as the main branch.
Run git branch to verify that you are on the new branch.
Run and submit the tests.

Troubleshooting
The switch command was introduced in Git version 2.23.0, so you might not have it if you're using an older version of Git.
