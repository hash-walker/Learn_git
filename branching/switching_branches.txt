Switching Branches
We talked about using git switch to change branches. There's another command that you'll certainly run into because it's been around for a long time and older developers are used to it: git checkout. git switch is a newer command that is meant to be more intuitive and user-friendly. It's recommended to use git switch over git checkout for simply switching branches.

To switch to a branch called prime:

git switch prime

# or, the old way:
git checkout prime
Copy icon
For this course, we will stick to git switch.

Assignment

Run git branch to make sure it worked (the branch you are "on" has an asterisk next to it).
