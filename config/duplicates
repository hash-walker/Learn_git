Duplicates
Typically, in a key/value store, like a Python dictionary, you aren't allowed to have duplicate keys. Strangely enough, Git doesn't care.

Unset All
The --unset-all flag is useful if you ever really want to purge all instances of a key from your configuration. Conversely, the --unset flag only works with a single instance of a key.

git config --unset-all example.key

Assignment
While only the most unhinged of projects operate this way, some projects, including WebFlyx, allow for multiple CEOs. Let's add a few more CEOs to the WebFlyx configuration:

git config --add webflyx.ceo "Warren"
git config --add webflyx.ceo "Carson"
git config --add webflyx.ceo "Sarah"

Take a look at your new cursed configuration:

git config --list --local
Copy icon
Remove all the CEOs from the WebFlyx configuration at once using the --unset-all flag.
