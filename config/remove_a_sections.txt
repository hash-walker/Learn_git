Remove a Section
As I pointed out before, the webflyx section is nonsensical because Git doesn't use it for anything. While we can store any key/value pairs we want in our Git configuration, that doesn't mean we should.

The --remove-section flag is used to remove an entire section from your Git configuration. For example:

git config --remove-section section
Copy icon
Assignment
Remove the entire webflyx section from your local Git config. You might notice that the default "core" section is still there, that's okay.
