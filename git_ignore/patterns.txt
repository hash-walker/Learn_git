Patterns
It would be rough if .gitignore files only accepted exact filepath section names. Luckily, they don't!

Let's go over some of the most common patterns.

Wildcards
The * character matches any number of characters except for a slash (/). For example, to ignore all .txt files, you could use the following pattern:

*.txt
Copy icon
Rooted Patterns
Patterns starting with a / are anchored to the directory containing the .gitignore file. For example, this would ignore a main.py in the root directory, but not in any subdirectories:

/main.py
Copy icon
Negation
You can negate a pattern by prefixing it with an exclamation mark (!). For example, to ignore all .txt files except for important.txt, you could use the following pattern:

*.txt
!important.txt
Copy icon
Comments
You can add comments to your .gitignore file by starting a line with a #. For example:

# Ignore all .txt files
*.txt
Copy icon
Order Matters
The order of patterns in a .gitignore file determines their effect, and patterns can override each other. For example:

temp/
!temp/instructions.md
Copy icon
Everything in the temp/ directory would be ignored except for instructions.md. If the order were reversed, instructions.md would be ignored.

You can read more about the patterns that are available in the official documentation if you'd like.

Assignment
Use this .gitignore file to answer the question:

# *.js

*.txt
!names.txt

/src/main.py

content.md
