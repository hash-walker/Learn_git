Cat File
Luckily, Git has a built-in plumbing command, cat-file, that allows us to see the contents of a commit without needing to futz around with the object files directly.

git cat-file -p <hash>
Copy icon
Assignment
Use the cat-file command to view the contents of your last commit.
For the CLI to be able to check your output, do it again, but redirect the output to a temporary file:
[catfile command here] > /tmp/catfileout.txt
Copy icon
Run and submit the tests.

Tip
Use git log -1 to get the hash of your last commit.
