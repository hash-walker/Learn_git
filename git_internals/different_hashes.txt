Different Hashes
My latest Git commit hash was:

You may have noticed that even though we (you and I) both have the same content in our repositories, we have different commit hashes. While commit hashes are derived from their content changes, there's also some other stuff that affects the end hash. For example:

The commit message
The author's name and email
The date and time
Parent (previous) commit hashes
All this to say that hashes are (almost) always unique, and because they're generated automatically for you, you don't need to worry too much about what goes into them right now.

Note: Hash = SHA
Git uses a cryptographic hash function called SHA-1 to generate commit hashes. We won't go into the details of how SHA-1 works in this course, but it's important to know because you might also hear commit hashes referred to as "SHAs".
