The Object File
Let's take a look at what's inside this suspicious commit object file.

Assignment
Try to cat the contents of the commit object file (which will interpret the contents as text).
cat path/to/file/from-before
Copy icon
Nope... it's a mess. The contents have been compressed to raw bytes!

Try again with the xxd command to print the contents of the file in hexadecimal format:
xxd path/to/file/from-before
Copy icon
Note: you may need to install xxd.

Do that again, but redirect the output to a temporary file so the tests can read it:
xxd path/to/file/from-before > /tmp/commit_object_hex.txt
