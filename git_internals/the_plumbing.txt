The Plumbing
So far we've been using Git in a "porcelain" manner. But to sate our insatiable curiosity, let's take a look at some of the "plumbing".

It's Just Files All the Way Down
All the data in a Git repository is stored directly in the (hidden) .git directory. That includes all the commits, branches, tags, and other objects we'll learn about later.

Git is made up of objects that are stored in the .git/objects directory. A commit is just a type of object.

Assignment
Use git log -n 10 to find your commit hash again.
Use ls -al to list the contents of the .git/objects directory.
Look for a directory that suspiciously matches the first two characters of your commit hash.
Use ls -al to list the contents of that directory and answer the question.
