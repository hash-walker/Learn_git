GitHub Repository
GitHub is the most popular website for Git repositories (projects) online. That is, for hosting "remotes" on a central website. GitHub serves several purposes:

As a backup of all your code on the cloud in case something happens to your computer
As a central place to share your code and collaborate on it with others
As a public portfolio for your coding projects
Git != GitHub
It's important to understand that Git and GitHub are not the same! Git is an open-source command line tool for managing code files. GitHub and its primary competitors, GitLab and Bitbucket, are commercial web products that use Git. Their websites give us a way to store our code that's managed by Git.

Create a GitHub Account
If you don't have a GitHub account yet, create one here. You will likely use this account heavily for the rest of your career as a developer, so add a good profile picture and use a sensible username.

Assignment
Once you've created your account, sync your GitHub account to Boot.dev and submit the check. The check simply ensures that your GitHub account is linked.
