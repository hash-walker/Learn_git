Merge Log

Your output from git log --oneline --decorate --graph --parents (aside from the hashes) should look something like:

*   89629a9 d234104 b8dfd64 (HEAD -> main) F: Merge branch 'add_classics'
|\
| * b8dfd64 fba0999 (tag: 5.8, add_classics) D: add classics

Each asterisk * represents a commit in the repository. There are multiple commit hashes on each line because the --parents flag logs the parent hash(es) as well.

The first line, with these three hashes: 89629a9 d234104 b8dfd64 is our recent merge commit. The first hash, 89629a9 is the merge commit's hash, and the other two are the parent commits.
The next section is a visual representation of the branch structure. It shows the commits on the add_classics branch and the main branch before the merge. Notice that they both share a common parent.
The next three lines are just "normal" commits, each pointing to their parent.
The last line is the initial commit and therefore has no parent.
