Commit
After staging a file, we can commit it.

A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a given point in time. It's a way to save the state of the repository, and it's how Git keeps track of changes to the project. A commit comes with a message that describes the changes made in the commit.

Here's how to commit all of your staged files:

git commit -m "your message here"
Copy icon
Assignment
Commit the contents.md file with the message A: add contents.md. You wouldn't normally start a commit message with "A:", you'd just write the message, but we're going to use letters to help us easily identify commits in this course.
Run git status again, and you should see that the file is no longer staged.
Run and submit the CLI tests from inside the webflyx directory.
Tip
If you screw up a commit message, you can change it with the --amend flag. For example:

# Change the last commit message
git commit --amend -m "A: add contents.md"
