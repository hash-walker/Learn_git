Config
The very first step of any project is to create a repository. A Git "repository" (or "repo") represents a single project. You'll typically have one repository for each project you work on.

A repo is essentially just a directory that contains a project (other directories and files). The only difference is that it also contains a hidden .git directory. That hidden directory is where Git stores all of its internal tracking and versioning information for the project.

WebFlyx
In this course, we'll be managing content for "WebFlyx", an imaginary self-hosted video streaming application. WebFlyx serves content directly from a Git repo!

Assignment
Navigate to somewhere on your filesystem where you'd like to store your project. Once you're there, create a new directory called webflyx and cd into it.

mkdir webflyx
cd webflyx
Copy icon
Once inside, create a new Git repository:

git init
Copy icon
You should now have a hidden .git directory in your webflyx directory. This means you've successfully created a new Git repository! List (ls -a) the contents of the directory to confirm.

Run and submit the tests from the root of the webflyx directory.
