Status
A file can be in one of several states in a Git repository. Here are a few important ones:

untracked: Not being tracked by Git
staged: Marked for inclusion in the next commit
committed: Saved to the repository's history
The git status command shows you the current state of your repo. It will tell you which files are untracked, staged, and committed.

Assignment
Every good content management system needs a table of contents.

Create a file in the root of your webflyx directory called contents.md and add the following text to the file:
# contents
Copy icon
Save the file, then run:
git status
Copy icon
Run and submit the tests from within the webflyx directory.

Troubleshooting
This course expects Git's output to be in English. If it is not, you can temporarily set your terminal to English.

export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

You might need to install the language pack for your system, e.g. sudo apt-get install language-pack-en for Ubuntu.
