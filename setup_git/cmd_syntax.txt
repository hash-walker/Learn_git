Command Syntax
Throughout this course, you'll see commands written like this:

command <required> [optional]
Copy icon
Arguments in angle brackets <> are mandatory and must be provided when running the command.
Arguments in square brackets [] are optional and can be included if needed.
For example, to create a new directory in your terminal, you would run:

mkdir <directory-name>
Copy icon
mkdir is the command
<directory-name> is a required argument
