Install Git
Git is a command line tool, just like the Boot.dev CLI. Let's install it.

Assignment
First, check and see if you already have Git installed. Open a terminal and type:

git --version
Copy icon
If you see a version number, you're good to go! Run and submit the tests.

Otherwise, you'll need to install Git. See below for help.

Windows (WSL) / Linux (Ubuntu)
sudo apt install git-all
Copy icon
macOS
Running git --version should prompt you to install Git. If not, you can use Homebrew:

brew install git
Copy icon
Alternatively, you can use Xcode:

Install Xcode from the App Store if you don't already have it.
Run xcode-select --install in a new terminal window. This should install the "Command Line Tools" package, which includes Git.
